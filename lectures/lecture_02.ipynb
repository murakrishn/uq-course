    "That is why such problems are also called **inverse problems**.\n",

    "Now, the amplitude we measure is not exactly the prediction of the model.\n",
    "Why is that?\n",
    "First, there is observation noise.\n",
    "Second, our model has a systematic error (e.g., we have completely ignored any dumping effects).\n",
    "So, *the measurement is not the same as the model prediction*.\n",
    "This means that we need to add one more node to the graphical representation of the model.\n",
    "The new node, let's call it $X_m$ is the result of the measurement."
