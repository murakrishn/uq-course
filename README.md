# Introduction to Uncertainty Quantification (old UQ course)

This course has been taught three times by Prof. [Ilias Bilionis](https://www.predictivesciencelab.org/authors/ebilionis/). You can find the old versions at the following tags:

+ [Spring 2018](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/uq-course/tree/SP2018)
+ [Spring 2020](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/uq-course/tree/SP2020)

The Spring 2018 version was recorded and the videos can be found [here](https://nanohub.org/resources/27789).

The course evolved to the following two courses:
+ The "ME 539 Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning" which is hosted in the [data-analytics-se](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/data-analytics-se) GitHub repository. This class is a standard Purdue course and it is also offered through [EdX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:PurdueX+ME597x+2T2020/course/). It is currently offered only to Purdue online students, but it will soon be available to everyone; and
+ The "ME 297 Introduction to Data Science for Mechanical Engineers" which is hosted in the [me-297-intro-to-data-science](https://github.com/PurdueMechanicalEngineering/me-297-intro-to-data-science) GitHub repository.

So, note that the Jupyter notebooks in this repository are provided without any support. Visit the above-mentioned GitHub repositories if you want to see to what they have evolved.
